                        <P id="about1"> <b> Jath Taluka </b>, located in the easternmost part of Sangli district in
                            Maharashtra, is the largest taluka in the district by area, covering approximately 2,240
                            square
                            kilometers. The taluka headquarters, Jath town, serves as a vital administrative and
                            commercial
                            center, well connected by roads and near the Jat Road railway station. Jath is known for its
                            dry
                            and semi-arid climate, receiving limited rainfall annually, which significantly influences
                            the
                            region's agriculture. Despite these challenges, the local economy thrives on rainfed and
                            well-irrigated farming, with major crops including groundnut, bajra, jowar, cotton, and
                            gram.
                            The region is also known for its vibrant weekly markets and a bustling cattle trade that
                            attracts people from surrounding areas.<br><br> <b> Historically</b>, Jath holds great
                            significance as a former princely state ruled by the Dafale Maratha dynasty before joining
                            the
                            Indian Union in 1948. Remnants of this heritage, including the ruins of old forts and royal
                            structures, still stand today. The area is rich in culture and spirituality, hosting several
                            historic temples such as the Yallamma, Rankesvar, and Ambabai temples, which draw large
                            crowds
                            during festivals and fairs. The Yallamma fair in particular is one of the most celebrated
                            events, drawing tens of thousands of devotees. The population of Jath Taluka is
                            predominantly
                            rural, with a strong sense of community rooted in tradition, language, and local festivals.
                            With
                            a population of over 3.2 lakh people as per the 2011 Census, Jath continues to grow while
                            preserving its distinct cultural and historical identity.</P>

                            which was one of the smaller princely states under British rule, the palace served as the
                            residence and administrative seat of the Jath rulers. The structure reflects the grandeur
                            and authority of the Maratha rulers of that period. <br>

                            Constructed primarily from <i>stone</i>, the palace is designed with <i>fortified walls</i>,

                        <P>Urad dal is a short-duration pulse crop grown mainly in India during kharif,
                            rabi, and summer seasons. It grows well in warm, humid climates and loamy to black soils.
                            The crop matures in 70–90 days and enriches the soil by fixing nitrogen. Basic fertilizers,
                            seed treatment, and weed control are important for good yield. It requires 2–3 irrigations
                            in summer. Common issues include yellow mosaic virus and pod borers. Harvesting is done when
                            pods turn black. Average yield is 6–15 quintals per hectare depending on conditions.

                            days depending on the variety. They are usually sown during the kharif season (June–July),
                            but some are also grown in rabi or summer. Seed treatment and timely weeding are essential.
                            Millets need minimal fertilizers and water, and most varieties are pest- and
                            disease-resistant.
                            <br>
                            Harvesting is done when the grains harden and plants dry. Millets are rich in fiber,

                            10–25 quintals per hectare based on the type and management.

                            season (June–July), but it can also be grown in rabi and summer seasons with irrigation.
                            Maize grows well in well-drained loamy soil and requires good sunlight and moderate
                            rainfall.
                            <br>
                            The crop duration is usually 90–120 days. Seeds are sown with proper spacing, and balanced

                            needs 4–6 irrigations, especially at critical stages like knee-high, tasseling, and grain

                                The sugar industry in Jath taluka, located in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, plays
                                a modest but growing role in the local economy. Although Jath is traditionally a
                                drought-prone region with relatively low sugarcane cultivation compared to other parts
                                of Sangli, it still supports a couple of operational sugar mills due to local processing
                                demand and improved irrigation facilities.

                                One of the key sugar mills in the area is the Rajarambapu Patil Sahakari Sakhar
                                Karkhana’s Unit No. 4 situated in Tippehalli.
